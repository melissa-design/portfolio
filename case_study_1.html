                <p class="col-12 col-md-6">We began with usability and accessibility heuristic evaluations of the website to look for areas of improvement and also straight away contacted the Trees for Life organization to get their input. To deepen our empathy for the Trees for
                    Life user, we interviewed two people who were similar to our proto-persona (one of whom had actually volunteered previously for TFL). We circulated a survey on social media and recieved 51 responses. We also completed 5-second tests
                    with these users for a few key Trees for Life pages to get their initial impressions. Finally, we conducted competitor research to determine what similar charities were offering on their websites.</p>

                    <p>From the interviews, we learned TFL needed:</p>

                        <li>Better content chunking for text heavy pages</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Those who filled in our surveys were most comfortable with donating and attending workshops. The NFP stakeholder contact highlighted the need to reduce text-heavy pages and make them more minimalistic and visually appealing, the need
                        for an on-line booking system for volunteering and a bigger emphasis on the organization being South Australian. A competitor analysis revealed that there was an opportunity to emphasize the carbon off-set offering and to provide
                        a workshop calendar.

                    <p>User-journey map demonstrates user pain points: Here is a user journey map of Jasper trying to sign-up for a workshop:
                        <ol>

                            <li> Jasper’s friend tells him about Trees for Life</li>
                            <li> Jasper locates the website</li>
                            <li> He wants to volunteer, but learns he needs to attend a workshop first</li>
                            <li> There is a lot to read and no sign-up form for workshops</li>
                            <li> There is only a link to an email address, so Jasper sends an email</li>
                            <li> He waits around for a while and finally gets a response - an email reply saying he needs to be a member in order to participate in the workshop (this is on the website, but not prominently displayed)</li>
                            <li> He goes to the TFL website and finds membership options on website</li>
                            <li> He confirms workshop over email</li>
                            <li> Goes to the workshop and makes friends with like-minded people and as a result continues to engage with TFL</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>This is a success story, but we can see many places where a less motivated person would have given up. A smoother and clearer path from interest to engagement is needed - namely, a workshop booking system. Perhaps also if the homepage
                            showed the impact of donation, Jasper may have considered donating earlier.

                    which could be implemented holistically across the site. As a team we created a mood board of images, fonts, and site layouts to create an aesthetic that would eventually influence our final design. In the end we opted to keep the
                    site's original font; Montserrat; however, we added softer edges on cards and buttons, as well as implementing a modern blue and green palette, along with aspirational imagery to create a calm and trusting feeling, whilst reinforcing
                    the brands goals and ethos.</p>

                    of usability testing, our design evolved until the point where we could present a high fidelity prototype. As a final step, we used a simple form of A/B testing on our high-fidelity clickable prototype to help us answer some questions
                    about the donation flow and finally arrived at the finished design.</p>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    <p>The final high-fidelity prototype includes a redesigned homepage that aimed to display the impact the NFP is making through number of trees planted, images and descriptions in a slider at the top showing visually what they do. The
                        homepage also highlights the offerings our user research indicated needed to be more accessible, namely; workshops, volunteering and donating. We also created pages for the workshop flow that visually chunked the information and
                        made it more digestible, while also adding a booking feature.</p>

                    <p>One issue we only came to realise at the end of the project was that potential workshop participants would need to become TFL members before signing up to a workshop. So, ideally, we would have created an integrated membership and
                        workshop sign-up process. Instead, we just included a link to the membership form, which isn't ideal. Alternatively, we could ask the organization how they felt about charging one-off fees to attend a workshop instead of requiring
                        membership, as this could be a good entry-point to higher levels of engagement.</p>

                    <p>We also redesigned the donation process. Initial user testing suggested it was difficult to locate a simple donation button; however, it could be argued that the new donation flow isn't a big improvement on the original design. Ideally,
                        I would in future like to revisit this section of the redesign to include more ways to donate and more information about where donations go to give greater confidence.</p>

                <p class="col-12 col-md-6">This project was a valuable experience in analysising an existing website for it's current user flows and, through user research and talking to stakeholders, determining how these flows can be improved. In future, we would talk to NFP
                    about workshops allowing non-members to attend for a small fee, or rolling membership sign-up into workshop sign-up process. We would work on a simplified volunteer information flow and sign-up process, add other features requested
                    by stakeholder e.g. new shop and add a contact form (as based on competitor analysis). This project really helped us learn to read every page of the existing website to fully understand their product before attempting to reimagine
                    it. To broaden the user research and to iterate accordingly</p>
