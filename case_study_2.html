                <p class="col-12 col-md-6">The Australian Space Agency has web-pages located within a larger website. It is difficult to navigate around the pages and users found the main page to be confusing with too many links.</p>
                <h3 class="offset-0 col-12 offset-md-2 col-md-4">The Solution</h3>
                <p class="col-12 col-md-6">Design a new, independent homepage for the ASA that reflects the goals and mission of the ASA and allows users to easily discover and access all content. Plus, a clearer funnel towards actions visitors can take.</p>
            </div>

                <h3 class="offset-0 col-12 offset-md-2 col-md-4">User Research</h3>
                <p class="col-12 col-md-6">The first phase of the redesign involved getting a clear picture of the existing content structure and using the site to understand the Australian Space Agency's aims. In future, it would be helpful to also hear directly from the organization
                    and to speak to some people who typically interact with the site. Next came evaluating the usability and accessibility of the original website. This was accomplished through heuristic evaluations and noting the results in tables and
                    through red-lining. To gain empathy for the users, I created a proto-persona and imagined the pages within the site that he would want to visit (user path and wire-flow), but also considered other potential users and their needs. Next,
                    I undertook two rounds of usability testing - the first focused on general usability and the second focused on the usability of the navigation structure. </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The homepage needed a clearer sense of hierarchy. Although there were some cards that were highlighted with images, there were also large portions of text with multiple in-text links which made the site harder to navigate and usability
                            testing showed users often struggled to locate key content.</li>
                        <li>The navigational structure of the page was lacking - as the ASA page is a page within a greater site, the navigational structure (top navigation, footer links and search) were directing users to irrelevant content.</li>
                        <li>The tone of the content was flat and uninviting when compared to the stated aim of the ASA to "inspire Australians in Space". I wanted to create a site whose tone and visual appearance better reflected what I understood to be the
                            Space Agency's goals.</li>

                <p class="col-12 col-md-6">The solution to the problems identified in the research phase appeared to be creating a new, independent website with it's own navigational structure for the ASA. Determining a new hierarchy for the whole site and also for the homepage
                    was a natural next step. I used a spreadsheet to note down every link in the main page and then all the links on the secondary pages. I used card-sorting to experiment with a new arrangements of content and eventually arrived at a
                    new site map, which was iterated several times as I continued the design process.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
                    <p>On the original main page, there were about 50 links and was attempting to address many issues. To avoid the problem of users being distracted and confused by so many options, I considered the hierarchy of content of the homepage and
                        decided to focus on the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>About the ASA</li>
                        <li>News</li>
                        <li>Careers</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>So, the new homepage is mostly aimed at stimulating interest in the ASA, sharing timely news and then using that interest to lead them towards getting a career in the Space industry. I imagined that, given more time, I would create
                        other landing pages that would be aimed at other important goals of the ASA, such as communicating the responsibilities of the ASA and sharing key publications as well as a page for the business community. Therefore, it became
                        apparent that the ASA might need to have several key landing pages that could be well optimised in search engines so that people reach the right part of the site, rather than one homepage that attempts to meet the needs of all
                        users.

                <p class="col-12 col-md-6">After establishing the site-map, I created a top navigation bar, search bar and footer for larger devices (e.g. desktop) and a smaller search icon, hamburger menu which displays a accordion menu and footer for smaller devices (e.g. mobile).

                        prototype to confirm it meets the user’s needs, reach out to the Australian Space Agency to better understand their priorities for the site and update further pages, especially those that are landing pages for other subsections
                        of the site, such as the mandate of the ASA, which could showcase their various roles and responsibilities visually.</p>
